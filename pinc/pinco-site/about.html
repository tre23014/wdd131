            <h2>Our Story</h2>
            <p>
                People in Need Coalition (PINC) began as a small group of volunteers determined to serve those
                experiencing hunger and homelessness in Idaho Falls. What started with just a few meals has grown into a
                powerful community movement providing consistent care, support, and dignity.
            </p>

            <h2>What We Do</h2>
            <p>
                Every week, we gather to provide free meals, offer community resources, and create a space of compassion
                for anyone in need. Our team is 100% volunteer-based, and our support comes directly from generous
                donors and local organizations.
            </p>

            <h2>Why It Matters</h2>
            <p>
                Food insecurity and homelessness are real challenges right here in our own neighborhoods. By showing up,
                week after week, we aim to make a lasting difference â€” one warm meal and kind interaction at a time.
